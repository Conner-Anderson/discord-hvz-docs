This documentation contains everything you need to manage an HVZ game with the help of Discord . For information about HvZ: humansvszombies.org Summary \u00b6 This bot was developed to run HvZ games at LeTourneau University in Texas, but is now published for use anywhere. A version of it has been used each semester at LeTourneau since Fall 2019. It is a simple and streamlined system designed to leverage the easy-to-use features of Discord which already manages accounts, permissions, and messaging. It was developed in response to the popular service HvZ SOURCE going offline. Features \u00b6 Registers players for the game through a questionnaire Accepts tag reports from players by validating tags, changing player factions, and announcing the tag to all players Displays the zombie tag geneology and other statistics Displays player and tag information in a live Google Sheet for easy administration Fully supports both desktop and mobile users Includes many commands for managing the game Includes configuration options and customizable questionnaires Works on existing Discord servers without disrupting non-players Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, though the docs are written for Windows Written in Python, potentially aiding personalization Prerequisites \u00b6 Mild tech-saviness. You must have dabbled in coding at some point, are not afraid of a command-prompt, and are willing to read a few StackOverflow pages if things don't go quite right. A Discord account that owns the server you want to run the bot on. You could also just get the owner to do a few setup steps for you. A Google account to access the Google Sheet and the Sheets API. A computer with an internet connection that can run the bot for the entire game. For example, you may leave your desktop on, borrow someone's old laptop, or use a Raspberry Pi in the closet. This documentation is written for a Windows PC, but with a little translation, should work fine for Linux or Mac. This software is for HvZ admin teams willing to do a bit of legwork to set it up, giving you an HvZ system entirely under your control.

You can start composing a command by typing / in any channel the bot has access to, which will bring up a list of available commands. Finish typing what you want, or select the command in the list. Commands are grouped into categories such as member and tag to stay organized. For example, to list members, use the sub-command of member like this: /member list . Most commands have arguments to supply, which Discord will prompt you to do fill-in-the-blank style. If asked to supply a member, you can start typing their name to select from a list. Most arguments will tell you what kind of response they expect, and if they are optional. In this documentation, arguments for commands are annotated like this: <input> means the argument is required, and you supply the contents. [input] means the argument is optional, and you supply the contents. input means you need to type \"input\" exactly as shown. ... means there are some arguments not listed that you can infer logically. Standalone Commands \u00b6 code \u00b6 /code Replies to a player with their own tag code in an \"ephemeral\" message only they can see, in case they lose it. This tag code is needed for zombies to log their tag. config \u00b6 /config <setting> [choice] Manipulates certain important configuration settings. Displays the current setting if no choice is given, and changes the setting if it is. Add settings here oz \u00b6 /oz <member> [setting] Reports whether or not a member is an OZ (original zombie), and changes their OZ status if setting is supplied. An OZ is defined as a player who is set as one in the database. This status has no bearing on the game, but is useful for tracking purposes. When an OZ is added with this command, they are given specific permission to access the zombie-chat and report-tags channels. This permission is invisible to other server members, and so can be kept secret. When an OZ is removed, these specific permissions are removed as well. You don't need OZs to run the game. Manually giving a player (even a human) access to the tag logging button is enough to get things started. See the silent-oz config option. post_button \u00b6 /post_button [text] [button_1] [button_2] ... [button_5] Sends a message in this channel that contains one or multiple buttons that will start one of the chatbots. It will also contain text if you choose. There is no limit to the number of the same button that can exist in a guild, and they can be deleted at any time. By default, the bot comes with two chatbot buttons: registration and tag_logging. post_panel \u00b6 /post_panel <element1> [element 2] ... [element 6] [static] A panel is a special message with attached game information, each of which is called an element . A panel can have multiple elements, such as the number of humans, number of zombies, players registered today, etc. There's a special element called GamePlotElement which displays a plot of human and zombie populations over the course of the game. The static option is by default false , which means the panel will keep its values up to date with the current game. If true , it will never change. Bug The GamePlotElement is a complex and really cool plot that has some issues right now. Check first to see if it works before showing players. shutdown \u00b6 /shutdown [force] Shuts down the bot, which must be restarted from the computer it is running on. If there are any chatbots running, they will be listed, and the bot will not shutdown. If force is supplied as true , the bot will shut down anyways, closing any chatbots. The members using those chatbots will be notified, and will need to start over. Member Commands \u00b6 member list \u00b6 /member list Lists all members. Generally, looking at the Google Sheet is a better option. member register \u00b6 /member register <member> Starts a registration chatbot with you on behalf of the selected member. You will answer all questions, but the member you selected will be actually registered. Helpful if the chatbot is acting up for someone, or they were accidentally deleted from the game. member delete \u00b6 /member delete <member> Removes the selected member from the game. They remain on the server and in tag records, but are removed from as a member from the database and have their game roles revoked. Will probably mess up some game statistics... Bug Cannot currently delete members no longer on the server. member edit \u00b6 /member edit <member> <attribute> <value> An advanced command to directly edit a member in the database. You should consult the Google Sheet before using this. attribute must exactly match the database column to change, as seen on the Google Sheet. value is the new value. The command does not check if this is a valid value! Warning This command does not yet support changing dates. It might work... but it might not. Use a database editor like DB Browser for SQLite to change dates until this feature is added. Tag Commands \u00b6 tag create \u00b6 /tag create <member> Starts a tag logging chatbot with you on behalf of the selected member. You will answer all questions, but the member you selected will actually make the tag. Helpful if the chatbot is acting up for someone, or if they just can't get to a device. tag delete \u00b6 /tag delete <tag_id> Deletes a tag log by its tag_id , as viewable on the Google Sheet. If the target of the deleted tag has no more tags against them, they are reverted to human. Remember, if you don't like this functionality, you can always swap their roles back via Discord. tag revoke \u00b6 /tag revoke <tag_id> Identical in behavior to tag delete , except instead of removing the tag, it is labeled as revoked . Statistics reporters such as tag tree will ignore the tag, and so can you when reading the Google Sheet. This is a more elegant way to remove a tag during a questionable dispute. tag restore \u00b6 /tag restore <tag_id> Restores a tag that has been revoked. Turns the tagged member back into a zombie. tag edit \u00b6 /tag edit <member> <attribute> <value> An advanced command to directly edit a tag in the database. You should consult the Google Sheet before using this. attribute must exactly match the database column to change, as seen on the Google Sheet. value is the new value. The command does not check if this is a valid value! Warning This command does not yet support changing dates. It might work... but it might not. Use a database editor like DB Browser for SQLite to change dates until this feature is added. tag tree \u00b6 /tag tree Trust me, this is your players' favorite command. It will post a geneology of zombies, showing who tagged whom. If the message overflows the 2000 character limit for messages, the message paginate with buttons to navigate the pages. Warning If the pagination feature is needed, the pages will not be navigable after the bot restarts. This is a potential thing to fix in the future.","title":"Commands"},{"location":"commands/#commands","text":"","title":"Commands"},{"location":"commands/#overview","text":"Discord's Slash Commands provide a robust way to control the bot.

When you remove a player's human role and give them a zombie role, they are a zombie. The bot will follow along behind the scenes just fine. Chatbots \u00b6 A chatbot is a conversation the bot holds with a member through private messages to collect information. By default, the bot comes with two: registration, and tag_logging. Chatbots are launched when the member clicks a button created by the post_button command, or when an admin uses the tag create / member register commands. Set up the bot and try one out! OZs \u00b6 An OZ is an Original Zombie: a zombie who is set up by the admins. Every game must begin with one or more OZs. As far as this bot is concerned, an OZ is a player who can click the tag_logging button even if they are human. There is an OZ command which is recommended, but that is merely an aid for convenience and to make later statistics easier. Chronology of a Game \u00b6 Registration \u00b6 To register Discord server members for the game, simply allow them to click a registration button . Registered users are then entered into the database, assigned generated tag codes, and ready to play. Players need to be given their tag codes before they can be tagged. At LeTourneau University, players were given green bandanas with their tag codes written in marker by the admins. In this case, the admins would just refer to the Google Sheet for these codes. Another option is to let players keep their own tag codes, such as on a piece of paper. They can retrieve them with the code command. Set up OZs \u00b6 In the default registration chatbot script, there is a field for players to request or deny being an OZ. If you keep this field, it's a great way to narrow the pool of players to select from. Regardless of how you select the OZs, the game begins when they make their first tag. Using the OZ command is a nice way to allow them into the appropriate channel without revealing their identity to the server. You should consider using the silent_oz config option at this point. Once the OZs are publically revealed, it is a good idea to give them the zombie role and remove their human role, since there's no pretense of secrecy anymore. Manage the Game \u00b6 After zombies are loose, the bot mostly handles everything, leaving you to deal with problems out in the real world. Zombies will use the tag logging chatbot to turn humans into zombies, the tags get announced in the appropriate channel, and the zombie channel starts getting more active. You should probably post with the tag tree command every so often to show players the dangerous zombies. There typically comes a point in the game where you will accept no new players. Use the registration config option to disallow new players, or make the registration channel inaccessible. When players use the bot wrong, or have disputes, or have some edge-case that I haven't thought of because they're human, use the various commands to manage it all.

By default, the bot comes with two: registration, and tag_logging. Chatbots are launched when the member clicks a button created by the post_button command, or when an admin uses the tag create / member register commands.

Every game must begin with one or more OZs. As far as this bot is concerned, an OZ is a player who can click the tag_logging button even if they are human. There is an OZ command which is recommended, but that is merely an aid for convenience and to make later statistics easier.","title":"OZs"},{"location":"running_the_game/#chronology-of-a-game","text":"","title":"Chronology of a Game"},{"location":"running_the_game/#registration","text":"To register Discord server members for the game, simply allow them to click a registration button . Registered users are then entered into the database, assigned generated tag codes, and ready to play. Players need to be given their tag codes before they can be tagged. At LeTourneau University, players were given green bandanas with their tag codes written in marker by the admins. In this case, the admins would just refer to the Google Sheet for these codes. Another option is to let players keep their own tag codes, such as on a piece of paper. They can retrieve them with the code command.","title":"Registration"},{"location":"running_the_game/#set-up-ozs","text":"In the default registration chatbot script, there is a field for players to request or deny being an OZ. If you keep this field, it's a great way to narrow the pool of players to select from. Regardless of how you select the OZs, the game begins when they make their first tag. Using the OZ command is a nice way to allow them into the appropriate channel without revealing their identity to the server. You should consider using the silent_oz config option at this point. Once the OZs are publically revealed, it is a good idea to give them the zombie role and remove their human role, since there's no pretense of secrecy anymore.","title":"Set up OZs"},{"location":"running_the_game/#manage-the-game","text":"After zombies are loose, the bot mostly handles everything, leaving you to deal with problems out in the real world. Zombies will use the tag logging chatbot to turn humans into zombies, the tags get announced in the appropriate channel, and the zombie channel starts getting more active. You should probably post with the tag tree command every so often to show players the dangerous zombies. There typically comes a point in the game where you will accept no new players. Use the registration config option to disallow new players, or make the registration channel inaccessible. When players use the bot wrong, or have disputes, or have some edge-case that I haven't thought of because they're human, use the various commands to manage it all.
