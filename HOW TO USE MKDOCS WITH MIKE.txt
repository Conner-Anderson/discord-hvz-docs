In PowerShell:

To "build" a local version of the docs:
	poetry run mike deploy [version]
	Example: "poetry run mike deploy 0.2.1"
	Use --update-aliases to set what is the "latest" version:
	Example: "poetry run mike --update-aliases deploy 0.2.1 latest"
To host a local server of the mike site:
	poetry run mike serve

To host an auto-updating version that is non-mike:
	poetry run mkdocs serve

To update an existing version on the online site:
	poetry run mike deploy --push [version]
	Example: "poetry run mike --push deploy 0.2.1"

To add a new, latest version to the online site:
	poetry run mike deploy --push --update-aliases [version] latest
	Example: "poetry run mike --push --update-aliases deploy 0.2.1 latest"

To run any of the above commands without "poetry run", first use "poetry shell".
